INSTALLATION
------------
1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE (if something goes wrong)

2. INSTALL ADMIN MESSAGE
   
   Unpack the module in your sites module directory. Then browse to 
   "Administer" -> "Site building" -> "Modules" and enable the module.
   
3. CONFIGURE ADMIN MESSAGE

   The module provides the block "Admin messages" where the messages are listed 
   and can be closed by the users. Enable it at "Administer" -> 
   "Site building" -> "Blocks". You probably want to hide the block for
   anonymous users: configure the block and check "authenticated user" at
   "Show block for specific roles".
   
4. CREATE A MESSAGE
    
   Go to "Create content" -> "Admin message" and enter a message.
   Optionally set "Message visibility" options. It should show up in the
   block when saved.
   
   NOTE: There is no access control included, just the standard access provided 
   by Drupal, which means that all users with "access content" permission can 
   view messages. So don't provide any sensitive information.
