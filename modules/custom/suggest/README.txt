How to install and configure this module

A. Need to create new field in 'green_site' - nodereference - field_suggested_map
// cut this idea // 1. You need to change the node id and name of the default public map in the module - and probably need to install the OG
	module that makes this a default group that all are automatically asigned to on registration
2. Give the correct permissions to 'suggest a site' - should be both anonymous & authenticated
3. Make sure both anon & authenticated have permission to submit sites 
4. Add a captcha
5. Change permissions - allow anon to see gmap for node & set lat/lon
6. Change OG settings so that posts aren't required to be with a group


At the moment people aren't auto-subscribed to a map. If theyr'e not on team or lead, then they suggest a site to the map.
