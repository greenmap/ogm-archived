Developed on drupal version:
4.7.2 (Should work on all versions of 4.7)

This is my first module release, please comment or suggest changes.
I have tested fairly extensively, but may have not caught everything.
This module allows an admin to set limits on the number of terms
that a node can have per vocabulary.  It also allows setting this
per content-type as well.  

eg: A page could allow unlimited terms in a category, but a story
could limit the same category to four. 

Settings for this module are in:
administer/settings/taxonomy_limit

The settings page does attempt to be as informative as possible
regarding the choices you make.  There are redundant checks for
the categories you select so that changes to how the category is
configured don't cause errors.  

This module requires categories to have the multiple option enabled.
It has been updated to allow freetagging categories as well.
