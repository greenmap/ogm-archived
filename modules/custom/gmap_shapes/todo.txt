Todo for Lines & Shapes

Need a radio button in the form early on to allow people to choose between marker, line & shape (done)
  - this will switch out the form js behaviour (done)
  - will switch out the options (hide markers, show line/shape types as appropriate)
      -- do this using a page reload and add something to the url so hook_form_alter kicks in 
      -- need to change what's required
  
Need to display lines & shapes on maps
  - load after points?
  - only load at a certain zoom level?
  - delay loading of all stuff
  


TODO CURRENT

Integrate with new system

Deal with errors when adding - foreach error in location, no lat/lon message
Need to make line/area selected and displayed upon edit as appropriate - mostly a map zoom problem
Key
Make line editable upon edit

Then...
Make lines toggle-able
Deal with on global basis
